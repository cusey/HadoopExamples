## Introduction   
Hadoop is a open software platform for distributed stoarge and ditributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters build from commodity hardware.

## Why Hadoop?  
* Data's too darn big - terabytes per day
* Vertical scaling does not cut it   
         1. Disk seek times    
         2. Hardware failures    
         3. Processing times    
* Horizontal scaling is linear    
* Hadoop: It is not just for batch processing anymore
